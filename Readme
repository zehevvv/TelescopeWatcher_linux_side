This exaplain how to enable the hot spot to run after reboot

our Setup Goals Recap
- Device: OrangePi 4 LTS running Linux
- Task: Stream camera data using MJPEG-streamer
- Challenge: Trigger MJPEG-streamer remotely from Android or PC without a router or external Wi-Fi
- Idea: Make OrangePi act as a Wi-Fi hotspot and host a service that listens for remote commands

🛠️ Step-by-Step Solution
=== Turn OrangePi into a Wi-Fi Access Point ===
Use hostapd and dnsmasq to create a standalone Wi-Fi network:

=== Install required packages ===

sudo apt install hostapd dnsmasq

=== Configure hostapd ===

interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211
ssid=OrangePiCam
hw_mode=g
channel=6
auth_algs=1
wmm_enabled=0

- Save this as /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf 

=== You tell hostapd to use that file ===
- Open the file:
/etc/default/hostapd
- Find the line that starts with #DAEMON_CONF="" and change it to:
DAEMON_CONF="/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"
- This line “points to” your config file—meaning it tells the hostapd service where to look for its instructions.

=== Restart the service ===

sudo systemctl restart hostapd

=== Install dnsmasq ===

sudo apt update
sudo apt install dnsmasq

=== Create a Custom Config File ===

- Instead of editing the default config (which is huge), create a clean one just for your hotspot:
sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.d/orangepi-hotspot.conf

- Paste this into the file:
interface=wlan0                # Use the Wi-Fi interface
dhcp-range=192.168.4.2,192.168.4.20,255.255.255.0,24h
address=/gateway/192.168.4.1   # Optional: resolve "gateway" to OrangePi


- interface=wlan0: This tells dnsmasq to serve DHCP on your Wi-Fi interface.
- dhcp-range: Defines the IP range for connected devices.
- address=/gateway/192.168.4.1: Lets you access OrangePi via http://gateway (optional but handy).

=== Disable the Default Config (Optional but Recommended) ===

- The default config file is /etc/dnsmasq.conf. You can comment out everything in it or rename it:

sudo mv /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.backup

- This ensures dnsmasq only uses your custom config.

=== Disable systemd-resolved

sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved

=== Restart the Service ===

sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq

- You can check if it’s working with:
journalctl -u dnsmasq

=== Assign static IP to wlan0 ===
sudo ip addr add 192.168.4.1/24 dev wlan0

=== Enable IP forwarding and start services ===
echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
sudo systemctl start hostapd
sudo systemctl start dnsmasq


Now your OrangePi is a Wi-Fi hotspot. Android or PC can connect directly.


=== Create or edit the startup script to start hostapd and dnsmasq ===
- Create the startup script:

nano /home/orangepi/startup.sh

- Paste this into the script:
#!/bin/bash

rfkill unblock wifi
sudo systemctl stop hostapd
sudo systemctl stop dnsmasq
sudo ip addr flush dev wlan0
sudo ip addr add 192.168.4.1/24 dev wlan0
sudo systemctl start dnsmasq
sudo systemctl start hostapd

echo "rfkill unlock"

- Make it executable:
chmod +x /home/orangepi/startup.sh

- If you want to start the mjpeg streamer python script to start after reboot, you need
- to add the next line in the end of the file "startup.sh"
python3 /home/orangepi/Desktop/TelescopeWatcher_linux_side/mjpeg_control.py 

=== Make the Hotspot Start on Boot ===
To ensure the hotspot starts automatically after a reboot, enable the services:

- Let’s say your script is located at:
/home/orangepi/startup.sh

- Make sure it’s executable:
chmod +x /home/orangepi/startup.sh

=== Create the Systemd Service File ===

- Create a new service:
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/delayed-start.service


- Paste this:
[Unit]
Description=Run startup script after 10 seconds
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c "sleep 10 && /home/orangepi/startup.sh"
Restart=no
User=root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


- This tells systemd to wait 10 seconds, then run your script once after boot.

=== Enable the Service ===

- Activate it so it runs on every boot:
sudo systemctl enable delayed-start.service


- You can test it immediately with:
sudo systemctl start delayed-start.service
